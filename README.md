# United Gaming Roleplay - User Control Panel

This repository contains the UCP resources for the United Gaming website.  

PHP5 is required to use these files, as PHP7 has deprecated and removed the mySQL functions used.  
Also, you're probably opening your server for SQL injections if you downgrade to run this.
