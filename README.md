# United Gaming Roleplay - User Control Panel

This repository contains the UCP resources for the United Gaming website.  
I stumbled across these files on an old hard drive. I assume these files are from 2013, or at least somewhere around there.
Funny enough, there are still some UG spin-offs out there, using a slightly modified version of this UCP.

It's been 4-5 years since I screwed up everything, because I was a shitty person. 
Maybe I still am. I decided to upload these files for the sake of nostalgia.

PHP5 is required to use these files, as PHP7 has deprecated and removed the mySQL functions used.  
Also, you're probably opening your server for SQL injections if you downgrade to run this.  


And let's not forget all the spaghetti, which makes maintaining or changing things hard. 
That probably explains why people still use unaltered version of this UCP.

Funny enough, these files (and server resources) are still for sale out there from when we were leaked.
